## review of [Riot](https://riot.im) client 

 - very similar to [telegram](telegram.org),
 - public [room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mychelium:matrix.org) can be visible to guest (no account needed ++)
 - possibility of [chat bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVVn-8CzXE) etc.   
 - however [discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me) has more features out of the box !

advice: use what is popular, as adoption/followers are important
 i.e. if we need to be present on several plateform so be it.
 however of the team efficiency we can go for the easier one
