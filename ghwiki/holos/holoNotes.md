   (krystal is bridging digital and organic)

### holoJourney :

 - past trajectory : trail (generated w. holologs)
 - future trajectory : projected destiny 



### universal law
 - law polarity
 (frequencies give the keys)

 - security is always from 2 points for KIO
 - system is open, each sphere is autonomous and have its own "law policing" intelligence
 - smart-contract can provide "zero-knowledge-proof" you abide by a contract :
    opening "verse" for you to join

 - holoKit doc on "readthedocs.org"

 - star tail (your journey / star map)

### holocompass 

we direction to guide you 
as in http://thenewcode.com/524/Lost-An-SVG-Compass-Rose-Generator

see also [*](https://www.one-tab.com/page/HVNHlkE7S52jb3c3V-u_aA)


### federated server 

 using dns to find out the server a la "libravatar"
 
 dig +short SRV _avatars._tcp.EMAILDOMAIN

### 60s TikTok as a carep repository !

pack content in frame at 24fps -> 24*60 = 1440 objects

720p => 3.796GB of raw-data

assuming 4bit per color it is still more than 1.8GB


### PoW replaced by proof of "stream"

 source resource cannot be deliver w/o stream ...
 therefore it give us a proof of elapsed time.

 a fast hashing farm can travel in its own future,
 however has to slow down to everyone's pace to be part to everyone's reality

### use ads as notification space

usually they are "placed" in the way : perfect for notification !


### fibo or krysthal  ?

The grid test !
(using FFT to extract the grid ... then 12pts vs 10pts)
i.e. different harmonic content

.
