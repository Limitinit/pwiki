### Model to sustainable living ...


use all marking tecvhnology to trackdown "poluttant"
and make it a public tax to eliminate all marked iteem

i.e. 


make repeated polution taxable (one single use)
fee if found one time use articles (a la perl -w !)

have basic income payd when people "report misallingment of the system, (not the person)
everyone is deemed of love especially the most poluer (part of care system)

1. marked plastic,

2.  value of plasitc is the number of reuse
  if low value plastic found gouve pay the delta to the collector and sublimit the piece to the 6R process

3. kapitalism is good for 'reprogram' these "non" understood human bad habbit 
  (lets' reprogram humanity)
