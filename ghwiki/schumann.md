# Earth Frequencies (ELF)


## Schumann Resonance (#SR)

Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, generated
and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's
surface and the [ionosphere][1].

### Measurements

Today Schumann resonances are recorded at many separate research
stations around the world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances
typically consist of two horizontal magnetic [[inductive coils]] for measuring
the north-south and east-west components of the magnetic field, and a
vertical electric [[dipole antenna]] for measuring the vertical component
of the electric field. A typical passband of the instruments is 3–100
Hz. The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts
per meter) is much smaller than the [[static fair-weather electric field]]
(~150 V/m) in the atmosphere. Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann
resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many orders of magnitude
smaller than the [[Earth's magnetic field]] (~30–50 microteslas) [PC06].
Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record
Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with
a [[ball antenna]], suggested by [[Ogawa et al.]], in 1966,[OT66] connected to a
high-impedance amplifier. The magnetic induction coils typically consist
of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of turns of wire wound around a core
of very high magnetic permeability.
