# Future of Shamanic Medecine

**Future of shamanic medicine**
_Catherine Godrecka_

There is a parallel health system to western medicine. It is
underground. We call it the shamanic world. People find this world in
search of spirituality and health, especially when everything else has
failed. They come to cure their incurable diseases, severe depression,
and self-sabotaging behaviors. In this shamanic world, doctors are
"shamans". Drugs are "sacred medicines" or “entheogens”. An entheogen
is a substance capable of generating God within. Common entheogens include
cannabis, MDMA, LSD, ketamine, psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, watchuma,
ayahusca, tobacco. Mystical experiences are side effects of treatment. In
this shamanic world, there are retreats instead of hospitals. There are
no patients, only brothers and sisters. The doctor’s appointment is
replaced with a shamanic ceremony. Shamans are medicine men and women
that heal the Spirit. It's off the radar. It's secret. To understand how
it all works, you have to be initiated. You have to become a shaman. This
presentation is about my journey to find underground medicine and embark
upon my own healing. I stumbled upon so many miracles, a connected
community, true doctors at heart. As a former strategy director in
pharmaceutical development, my conclusion is that entheogens are powerful
and effective medicines. Many entheogens are illegal and labelled as
psychedelics. The tragedy of prohibition is that entheogens have the
potential to be the most successful psychiatric medicines known to man.
They should be made available to everyone and they should be lifted from
the underground to become mainstream medical practice.
