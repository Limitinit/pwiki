# Human Test

what make us human : our social contract ...

instead of captcha : establish a legal contract
where a breach of trust is costly ! (w/ money in escro)

> we accept the use of bots as long as
 it doesn't seal valuer away from our own business
 or trigger a DoS
 or ..

### Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs)

```
Classical cryptography has often factored humans out of the equation: when we say Alice and Bob can communicate securely (or authenticate, or sign, or perform a zero knowledge proof), we really mean Alice and Bob's computers can communicate securely. This has resulted in humans being a major security hole in practice. Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) are an attempt to bring humans back into the picture.
HIPs provide solutions to at least two basic problems in human-related cryptography: telling human users apart from computers (or `bots'), and authenticating single humans securely in the presence of very powerful eavesdroppers.
