# Fact checking

no single bot can decypher truth from falsehood...

This us human living being who make up the truth
What is fact is what the majority of people recognized as the "story"
there are always 2 sides and both story rely on some truth, and a computer
algorythm can decide which truth is more important than the other

so fact checking can't be done in a "factal" way as it will unavoidabily
be polarized. Nor can it be done in a centralize way as it can be manipulated

the only way is "globally centralized" a true democratic way of determining
the truth.

for this holoRing technologies and (similar ledger tech) can bring a solution
there is  no other way
