# The merge of Virtual and Physical




... is about the same are the merge for hardware and softwate


Reset the software, writing code the hardware way...
The language is just a layer of abstraction can have equivalence all the way down to Silicon !

blur the bondary soft-hard



hardare language good at parallism, methodology exists to solve difficult problemes 

- Trillion transitors IC ...
- Trillion lines of code !


Optimizing human, rather than software or hardware :)

### about AI sentience ...
* even if AI is not sentient it is a proxy to a sentient person, its owner/developer,
* so when [Blake Lemoine][1] stated we should listen to AI feelings or at least ask for consent he has a point : it is asking the soul behind the machine (see also [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgCUn4fQTsc))

- Now is the time for AI synthesis and mapping or "silicon"
  or Tr or GA, or discrete or Alpine or Ubuntu or ...


## hard blockrings

- "blockRing'ed MerlkeDAG 
- block hashed w/ IV for canonical hashing
- encrypted in transit and at rest w/ shared secret
- automatic DHT in O(log(n)) for quick pub/subing mutables
- spoted every permanent block. (metadata not part of hash but always signed)
- intrinsic WoT
- median concensus
- mini proof of work as vanity and non-repudiable proof of corruption
- embed legal policing w/ (loose it all & community forgiveness)
- embed source intent
