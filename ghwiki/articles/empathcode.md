## conflit resolution and merge: empathic coding vs. bullying code

Most of us have memory of code merge nightmares,
and refacturing that break the complete code base.
Who to we address there major hurdles along our coding journey.
We some strategy are more prone to conflicts thant other.
We review here some key learning in conflit resolution technique
we borrowed from our social lives and apply it to code !


![conflict]()


Like in life, conflict resolution is an art.
GIT merges can be a nightmare, essentially because most code are selfing
can blind to others. A code that is easy to merge is an empathic code !

It you code with a "listening" mindset, you merge will be a breeze.

What is a "yes and" approach compared to "no but" style.

With a "no but" coding style you create conflit right from the star
not knowing other coders intention, you overwrite their code w/ care etc.

With a "yes and" coding style you listen first to embrase others code
with the full intent and add on it without destroing anything.

Listening mean understand the other development flow and code evolution
and don't disrupt its course. adding on top is also making sure interferance
are limiting, and merge code are harmonious.

This can be achieve in adopting a style that facilitate cherry-picking
code in "atomic" cherry simple and easy to understand and pick.
create "pickable" and unbreakable code. 

codes usually break at interface, "something changes",
a variable is added, format changes etc. and portion of code is not
consistent w/ the update etc...
adopt a [IRP] methodology and it will be "[anti-fragile][2]"


This will inspire empathic coding for other developers, and generate
mergeable code.

we addopted a blockRing approach to coding such that each merge
is an execution of a smart contract, this means we agree on a merge
strategy before coding and therefore we know what is consider bullying coding
and what is not !
