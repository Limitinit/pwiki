## to consider
1. People in the field working on pieces that are synergistic to our
   p2p ci project but are not talking about conscious evolution and this
   is a concern.
2. It is important to look at what Open Business Model approach we plan to
take.
3. An abundance of [[tools]] can slow down the collaboration process.
