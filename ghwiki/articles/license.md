Note about GPL licensing from finalcrypt:
```
OpenSource: A "Free Software Foundation" fairy tale of Honor and Idealism made up by Capitalists

The term "OpenSource" has been made up by the Free Software Foundation to masquerade their intentions
OpenSource suggests accessible source where in fact legal rights to edit and release derivatives are meant

The meaning "Open" does not mean "Change" as "Open shops" do NOT give you the right to "Change shops"

GPL means that anyone can wait for OpenSource to mature and then run off with it to commercialize / exploit it
GPL licenses seem to be designed in favor of capitalists milking cheap / free "OpenSource" software developers
The common people develop an idealistic need and the industry gets in the middle, scales up for growth and profits

The Free Software Foundation needs to be clear and rename the term OpenSource to reflect on it's intentions like:
"PublicSource", "EditSource", "DerivativeSource", "AllRightsSource", "CommercializeSource", "ExploitSource"

The FinalCrypt sourcecode is available to anyone and even grants edit rights (without commercial / derivative rights)

The danger to edit, commercial & derivative rights

Edit & Derivative rights demands the right to build in anything (like back-doors) and release (counterproductive) derivative works
Allowing building in backdoors is a severe security threat, which is why GPL3 should NEVER be used on security software
