# my ideal collaboration plateform


something similar to

 - thegood.cloud for the UI (plain simple)
 - to keybase for keys management
 - inline MIME type encryption
 - OTP (futureCrypt) nountable drive
 - to IPFS for storage
 - with a code-pad REPL "runnable" 
 - selectable collaboration w/ OT, CRDT, togethe.js 
 - merge3 visual diff pad ...
 - all is a wiki too !
 - we extra bells and wistle :
   - social feed (a la FB !)
   - chat (a la discord w/ threads)
   - audio (a la mumble)
 - optional video conf jitsi or zoom 

AND using the "zero-bw" concept (on-demand connection)
