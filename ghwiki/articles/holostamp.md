## Trusted Distributed randomness is hard to achieve


however in permission network trusted pseudo randomness is achievable,

if we use a PRNG using a secure hash the only flow is the seed chosen by the user;
if we have a trust metric about the user then we have a quality of his/her choice


the XORing of all the number in a trusted network is ok if none of the data is reveal
# before all participant pushed the choices

so instead we collect signature on n challenge and the hash of the of the block is the final
draw, (redraw and "PoW" can be used to bias the system
so it is important to control the "trajectory" of the passing challenge to make it resistance)
trajectory is made spots are defined before hands.

i.e. People are signing their spot, leaving entropy behind, and the random oracle "collect"
these entropy to make the final decision !

(life is syntropic, which create AI entropy can can be collected to make proofs)
the unpredictable make the predictable possible
