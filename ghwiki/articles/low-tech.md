# Low-Tech : data is more important than tech.

In health self awareness and journalling are more important
than beeng tracked and monitor 24/7
as we might lose our ability to self assess our health parameters
while wearing bio-sensors...


we better of using a "no-battery device" that will transfer data
only on demand, and therefor doesn't have to be worn !
