# The DNA Blockchain 


The titin protein (TTN gene chromosome 2q31) has 35K Aminos Acids with 6bit each  log(64)/log(2) coding only 22 AAs so
there is some redundancy for "protein" steganogaphy.

![AAs](https://dweb.link/ipfs/QmYtvk2EEAyez33FmtSWsXPZtpatAzHDe24NvuynzWeYUA)

and with a  half line of 30hours it is perfect with plenty of redundancy
version of the genetic code available that would lead to isoform and is
it is shortlived in out muscle we have to synthesize it all the time !
good for a "transactional"  DNAblockchain !
