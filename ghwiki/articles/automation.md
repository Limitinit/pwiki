# Job loss via automation !


No,automation doesn't reduce job, it makes them evolve
we still need people to repare than drive the bots !

to date I don't know any automation that is autonomous
and doesn't break if unattended (this is due to extrodinary-mutability of life)

any devs know there is no single site that doesn't have a 404, 503 etc error
that requires a human fix ...

average lifecycle of a web site is les then 2 years

the greed is what kills job, we remove "expensive" skill employee for cheaper
maleable fresh out of school staff that can be squized the life energy off.
