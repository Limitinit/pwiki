# I believe ...



I believe ncov2 is a "diminishing" virus, it affect the organism
such that it is not capable of healing itself.

hence causing lasting "damages" in the body...
principaly auto immune or "mechanical"

It might act as a "reprogramming" virus, creating such a choc to the immune
system that it creates a alergic reaction or overwhelming immune response.

Treatment of covid might well require a relearning of own immunity
which can solety be done w/ symbiotic help of a living micro-biome
