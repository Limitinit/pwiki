# Solving the broken web

content addressable storage have the nice property
the links never breaks as long as the files are still seeded
so moving file in cold storage leads to permanent files system
where we can always retrieve an old file

making the system suitable for [[ledgers]]


even IPFS which goals is to make the web more reliable
leads to the creation of some "broken" links
