# Morning Clarity

Today is $Date: {{HDATE}}$ : A prime Day
Yesterday was $YesterDate$


## Notes:

  - make some thyme tea w/ honey and sambuscus today

  
*Priority*:

 - cleanup funds situation 
 - move funds to US account via borderless bank
 - call tax office for negociating a recovery plan
 - [[backlog]] do one thing a day
 - call dad :encode:[+33 492 51 5377](callto:+33492515377) or +33 679 63 3201:clear:

# Insight:

  - no to BTC style proof of work : this is entropic behavior and "pay your punition first" as we don't trust you... this is not put at risk some value, it destroy value and assume it is transfered to bitcoin
  - a monnaie "temp libre" such that you can't get more than 1 month per month !
  - synthetic AI is nothing else than differed BruteForce
  - computational AI is a waste of energy unless it is quanticAI
  - topTalent / talentAI : to pick and optimize profiles/skell with demands.
  - hire at the exact Market Rate Distributed Talent Exchanges

  - ethical trust (obtained by comparing registry differences and conflicts)
  - ipfs version of termbin.com (file.git)
  - json overlay and underlay the same way we unionized *.idx (i.e. a la docker)
  - twitter as a notary
  - ipfs-link might be the most important later of IPFS as fs are intrinsically mutable
    and this will naturally expose MFS to the outside
  - SWARM is sensitive to DDoS (however cost of storing mitigate this)
  - quantic time : 41 steps per tomatos -> at admin clock freqency... etc
  - global consciouness state : "scan-path" we one random word per node
  - encryption : feminine xor masculine : partiki phasing
  - n-bit dna = "seed" for OTP xor encryption, need to be consciously initialized
  - oracle : context+word -> next word

  - organic bandwith = 0 : no need data already here (topping)
  - AI need energy to move data it doesn't have arround (degenerative way)
  - IPFS data glocally here (nothing need to be move unless it's mutable or present
  - procrastination of crystalization a moon period to reprogram the brain
  - habit of ritual (because upload to the holosphere is slow, 28 days to write in the physical
  - CU virtual, zero BW, already omnipresent however need recording of the wave in the physical realm : where it get its mass !
  - this is the "self" protection of the holoSphere : reprogramation is difficult (smart contract)
  - universe doesn't need to move it is there we are just unaware,
  - consciousness is moving the blockage arround (emotions), shadows to see through transparencies (alchimy shining light truth reality)
  - program by repetition until it requires no energy to do it (i.e all information is fully "downloaded")
  - effortless living w/o blockage (10000hours or  728 to 16120 hour rules ...)
    - 672 : 28 * 24 = 28 days full consciousness
    - 728 : 728 * 8/24 / 24 = 10 days
    - 2000 : 2016 * 8/24 / 24 = 28 days
    - 16120 * 8/24 / 24 = 224 days = 7.3 months
  

  - no-one but AI is anonymous 

  - smart promises,s
  - P2P functionality
  - P2P engine
  - one smart-neuron per node (fractal structure)
  - particpatory pining with scale 0 - 100%
  - freq. reward according
  - building the "human organize"
  - with ads place as our communication channel (no deceptive message anymore)
  - replace all images as notify area once they fall below a ranking threshold
  - kgi

## Technology insights

  - encryption as "<span src={{qmhash}} class=enc>{{qmhash}}<span>"
  - keyrings served at document owner's node

## Business insights

- web of trust (if "untrusted" FoF then propose option to by trust)
- leading to an economy w/o the cost of trust :
  you buy it ahead of time at known cost
- don't pay advertizer w/ your data (use privacy aware systems)
- advertizers are "rent extractor" using your own data

## One article a day 

## Yesterday

  - $Prev: $

## BackLog ...

 Dashboard:
   - IPFS [warning page][wp] w/ explanation for install
   - ledger form
   - artifact page
   - w/ time logger
   - buckets
   - single page : audio, video, memo, article, quicknote, code
 - add "nshash" (a la ipns)
