# Shard Attack ...

all sharded distributed db is subject to a "shard attack"
if shard is based on a hash or controlable in a way.

an attack would feel like some sort of delayed DoS
as the shard will feel up over time and will "unbalance" the tree.

-> Sharded need to be "keyed" with an OTP

(shard like sea water ! need to be salted)
