# The Software industry gone bad ...

There is not such a tools that doesn't install without a glitch
and stop working over time.


The complexity of our system is enormous and this make everything
so brittle, moreover it requires more and more skills to fix, repair
and maintain working system.

Leading to a increasing gap between the tech savvy and the other.

    The world is not run anymore by the banks but by the Geeks !



Let's take a simple example:

  we want to use gitbook across all our plateform as a publishing software


run the install on linux (Ubuntu 18.04) with very smooth.
Repeat the operation on Ubuntu 20.04 a very deps were broken but nothing serious.
Went on a Mac to install gitbook, it failed

A software developed by professional CS engineers, just won't install
on half of the computer of the planet !



### How we address this.

SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY

We make an effort to use technology that can last and are future proof.
we solely use tools that have been verifiy to work on all major plateforms:

Linux, Windows, Mac, Android.

We apply a rigourous CI/CD flow to garantee functional dependencies.
