# What is missing in modern tools / technology

After reviewing some of the tools available, here is what I found ...

Generally most softwares have a very fragile ecosystem (dependancies etc.)
and carry an extra complexity that we could go without !


git: simple tangible view of what's going on! 
     simply use the filesystem a la *clearcase* (a transparent git-fs)
     don't make it hard to rewrite history or make it impossible

ipfs:
 - missing cameleon hash
 - plain git hash to make all git-object discoverable
