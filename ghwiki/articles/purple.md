# Purple is the new black



We repair decayed tech and abandonware 

Everything that doesn't get attention is entropically bound to break.
Technology is very fragile and brittle even the most robust
eventually breaks.

This is even more true for modern complex technology.

This is the nature of complexity, the huge dependency tree that
is responsible for the "programmmed" obsolescence...

All CI flow eventually fall apart for a missing piece.

This is more true for blockchains and ledgers

they reply on brittleness for security:
If it is broken then it is tampered with,

The problem is: time itself is tempering with it and everything.


We take take grey technologies and revamp them in purple

we call it grey when they expired 


- blue tech is the cold zero waste 
- purple tech is consciously zero waste (a blue tech w/ a warm heart)

- simple, self contained, self repairable (no expiration)

- blockchain -> blockRing


Reuse,
Repair Repair Repair

CAS are very fragile, we always miss a block

unbreakable permanent link do breaks




 - everything must have a "repair" manual,
   which is a document explaining the creation
  dependencies and installation, a "re-creation" guide is other words
