# LOVID20 (the after the upgrade from covid19)

 a charter for a new humanity (post confinement)

With this upgrade the problem is you can't go back
as soon as you return to the old habits, or got beyond your limits
you get the symptoms back

 - shortness of breath,
 - headache
 - chest pain
 - dry eyes

The reason is simple this virus is for total "himmunity" shift
and 
I believed until we acquire an herd *umanity* the virus will be hosted
in our body to complete the upgrade.

So the is no come back from #LOVID20,
we have to be courageous as we are the new humanity pioneers

What does it means

 - abandon the old system unless the absolute necessity
 (we have been prepared for this during the confinement for this right?)
 - all the people affected can't return in a business as usual
 - we have to exit the "cancerous capitalism' as we know it and
 - switch to circular harmonious economy, we won't be able to "get up" in the old system

 - we have a tremendous opportunity to "resurrect" and transition smoothly in a new system
   which is a global self organization for the complete humanity around the globe
   a new humanity formed with collectivities, within there is no exclusion,
   no unjustified suffering, no abuse

Are you ready to for a de confinement in the new society the one we collectively build ?
that requires a change of mindset, the release of old dogma and believe system.
are you open to embrace the beautiful you self the beautiful us ?

I am ready as it fells so good to be part of a new human family, no fear to have anymore
we can adventure out create, explore and share the wealth it generates within our communities
in return we received the safety health and comfort we need to thrive as human being
part of the global ecosystem of the planet and universe

we can be confident that the harder times are behind, together symbiotic life
will get us anywhere we collectively want, a regenerated earth that loves us and we love back.

I have been working the past several years on tools for this new era, a system to put aside
the conventional financial system, succeed in living this way for the past 3 years

for this to work we have to train our "ego" differently, there is no more personal gain
all what you do benefit the whole humanity, decisions are not anymore individualistic.

our new criteria is "how by my actions I can collectively improve the community, my environment etc."
my wealth is the energy that flow among us and is fuelling the global organism to repair and heal itself

if you want to be "individualistic" acquired the consciousness you are the whole human organism
and do all in your power for humanity to benefit from your action, and at the immediate level
you become a happy "cell" sharing the health of a well functioning society.

(how can it be well functioning ? You may ask, well if it because now we have the ability to 
create it, modify it real time collectively and alone we can't do much, however collectively
at global scale it incredible what we can do how we can self organise,
try it you'll see)

This is a sharing economy, there is no personal wealth anymore all our need can be largely supported by
all as humans being we have this capacity to re-create ourselves totally and take us out of the mess
we have the support of all living forms, you'll see nature will welcome us back in her rich "home"
I seen the bees and bugs helping me back from my own little green balcony bringing me exactly what
I need to heal and help me in my current state.

How do it work with our financial ties, we still have to pay rent, buy electricity, food etc...

Well there is thing we can't initially get without the old money, and if we are not numerous
enough it will be difficult to "bootstrap" the new economy,

however you really have to at least temporally update your believe system.
there is nothing that prevent you to thrive without money,
if you want to transition to a new value system, you have to abandon the old one

The new value system is "KIND", indeed it make the Euro and Dollars and other official currencies worthless.
The only use of the old money will be to solely pay for the old system and gradually be phased out.

all the following can be totally supported within the new economy, we just need to be together in it

 - food & water
 - shelter
 - health
 - transport
 - education & knowledge
 - art
 - common goods

The old money will get us "oil and electricity" until we acquire enough people to be globally "autonomous"

 so to all the people who the covid-19 into unrecoverable debt
 please join in, consider your debt cancel, indeed if the old currency value is Zero you don't have debt
 and start with the new economy,
 you have an "existence" credit as a living being to sustain your an other life
 by bonding with on another all "old world expenses" can be paid back with a reserve / pool of old worthless money

 Consider it as "export / import" to and from the old system

 use the "KIND" money to reconstruct yourself and boot the new humanity and export your talent and skill
 to the old world to feed the "old money funds" that will collectively pay for our necessary imports

 do the maximum in the new system as we want to reach "self sufficiency" as soon as possible.

 The key for this to succeed is that we collectively communicate and address our need
 by putting our mind together we are really powerful to address all major problem that will arise
 we just have states them clearly and will to collectively solve our own problems and also others'

 What do you think ?

 Feel free to modify and edit this initial text such that its a better "blue print" for what is to come

Immense Gratitude to all of us, and please talk about this around to your friends, family and everyone
as we want all of us to be part of this amazing transformation.
