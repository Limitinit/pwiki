# Democratic Governance


Let comment on theses ... because technology can nowaday change the "scale" of our democraties !


> "Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch."—Benjamin Franklin (allegedly)

Can I Have My Democracy?
What if you genuinely have good intentions? Can you use democratic principles to govern the country well?

History shows us that it may be possible. The larger the territory and the population, however, the more difficult it becomes to manage it. You simply do not care enough about things you do not see.

Greek city-states were small enough for politicians to be within walking distance from anybody displeased with their work. Public servants themselves walked the streets of their city daily and saw with their own eyes its deficiencies. Compare it with modern nation-states that, at times, cover whole continents. It is physically impossible to manage any of it efficiently, no matter how good a power vertical you set up.

Therefore, in the question about the validity of democracy, the bottom line is scale. And scale it does not.
