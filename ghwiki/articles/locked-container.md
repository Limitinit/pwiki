# docker app running in a locked container




The container is yours we trust you won't temper w/ it, or else ?


- runner a encrypted code, decrypted using a dh_secret
- output stored in a permissionned blockring w/ spot (leave a "physical trail", consume entropy)
- AI trained checker, where learning need to be done in person





locked blockring :
 - take a chain, put a lock, throw the key




It is all a matter of trust !
