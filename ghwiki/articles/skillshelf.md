  Did you know the average shelf life of skills is less than 5 years? It is critical that organizations invest in talent development and help employees keep their skills current.


Somehow I disagree because by having switch activities 5 years ago would have made me totally "obsolete" in my old skill which was the semiconductor IC design.

19 years of career has no shelf life limit the skill we learn along our lives are here to stay as they are registered in out "brain muscle" memory. 

I am just curious where do you get that limitation, or is it just an hiring practice that most corporation looks for fresh acquired skills in order to have a better ROI on their hiring.

I would love to learn more about your opinion on this ?

best regards,
+Michel
