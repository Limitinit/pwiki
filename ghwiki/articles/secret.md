# How I share my secrets


Secrets are the soul identities, each time I share a secret
I create a new conscious identity
who is aware of this shared secret (a.k.a trust)
and is composed of the shared knowledge of parties in the trust.

All quAtoms can have a "hidden" part which is a quantum of knowledge
that is out of sight from the public as it is in the "shadow" of this
trusted consciousness.

As soon as the light is shined on the secret in the shadow it is revealed to
the public and the "trusted consciouness" vanished, leading to the "revocation"
of the secret.
