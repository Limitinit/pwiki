## The steps for gradual change


on the path to change : 3.5%, 10%, 16%, 20% ...

### 3.5% (or sqrt(10%))

### [10%][3] is all you need !



Scientists have found that when [just 10 percent][1] of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of the society.

> "Once that number grows above 10 percent, the idea spreads like flame."
~ Roland Schmitt
 
> "In general, people do not like to have an unpopular opinion and are always seeking to try locally to come to consensus."
~ Sameet Sreenivasan

 "Social consensus through the influence of committed minorities." [JXIE0721]
 
### 16% crossign 'the chasm'

Maloney's 16% rule refers to [crossing 'the chasm'][4]

*   2.5 % innovators
*   13.5% early adopter
*   34% early majority
*   34% late majority
*   16% laggards
