Crypto greed: wallstreet going virtual : metagreed

a loan broker makes deals with high return due to high risk investments
the issued a coin for their pool of investors promizing them high yield
they auction coin to down-bid the rewards :
 the less greedy the investor are the greedier the broker is !
 
I think it is a sick exploitation of startup needing investment to be creative
and to make it.
It is rent extraction right at the heart of entrepreneurial innovation
normal so many enterprise failed in the wallstreet style jungle.

This a case of the prisoner paradox...
 if bidders compete it is they loose
 however if the cooperate they wins
 
 "Dutch to English" automatic bidder ...
