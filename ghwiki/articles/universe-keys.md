### After an exchange:

I honor the place in you in which the entire universe dwells.
I honor the place in you which is of love, truth, light, and peace.
I take back what is mine in you, I give you back what is yours in me
Thank you
When You are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me,
and We are complete.
Namaste
