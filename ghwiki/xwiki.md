# xwiki (review)

## xwiki an "apps enabled structured-wiki"

   i.e.  "filesystem hierarchy" w/ plugable apps ...
   
   == collaborative dashboard + wiki
   
   nothing fancy on the wiki side, plain classic w/ tags
   
   typical application are :
     * calendar
     * file browser
     * ...
   
   drawback: centralized, (opensource but not open-data: dataimport no dataexport execpt manual)

-> will be good if "holoboard" has similar concept "wikified-dashboard"
