# Morning Clarity

Today is $Date: {{HDATE}}$ : A prime Day
Yesterday was $YesterDate$


## Notes:

  - make some thyme tea w/ honey and sambuscus today

*Priority*:

 - Stoppable blockchain ("forbidden wallet")
 - DEX were price is set with "median" orderbook no nanotrade, no "extractive" manipulation
 - price set by AMM can be manipulated via "GameStop" effect
 - meta/holo-verse are attactive as "freedom playground" (escaping real world rules, governance heaven)
 - sync'ed network using cryptographic DLL (VDF)
 - cleanup funds situation 
 - move funds to US account via borderless bank
 - call tax office for negociating a recovery plan
 - [[backlog]] do one thing a day
 - call dad :encode:[+33 492 51 5377](callto:+33492515377) or +33 679 63 3201:clear:
 - focus: <http://127.0.0.1:8088/michelc/pwiki/focus.md>

# Insight:

  - unique service or "non-competition" market (hedge market)
  - SQLogin style with "secret keeper" to return API key for "client-run" app
  - median-distributed-consensus: using a chain crawler to "validate random branch" and the last 12 blocks (optimist algo vs. global)
  - sound to increase bioavability of nutriments
  - physical,mental,emotional,biological,imunity,hormonal health tracker a la "uptimebot" improve what you track
  - Global Brain/Heart : giant-event-driven tree-sheets with NLP/Markov/Bayesian filters
  - ML "Not" traget predictor
  - Blockchain in its simplest form + wallet,balance,views etc. as "cached" Smart contract running on any engine
  - dusting burn-coin : bet on the proof of lost, loan its value and charge an +11% tax to mitigate the risk of false proof
  - a stable coin is a coin that capture "deflation" i.e. in which sell price is exactly the same as it's original buying price.
  - access key requiring multi private/shared secrets xor-hash-dh(origin,source,recipient)
  - BloomKeys as a way to reduce overal keys in a bigdata lake
  - Reuse BTC for its "hash commitment" functionality only w/o PoW but rather a median-consensus (BFT)
  - AIshell + AIvim w/ completion & memo
  - public coder w/ extreme coder
  - public notary as "RawShare"
  - use nature intelligence
  - virtual manufacturing
  - not on google rabit-hole
  - quantically reversable gates/function w/ probabilistic q-bit in reverse path, with probability propagation computation
  - bayasian AI for warm-q-bit (drop in water effect, dillution model)
  - meta-language data as frontmatter, code as gepetau pragmas w/i native language, function w/o intereface, global naming space, interface build as needing as in .vrl data immutable, code mutable and learned, entangled variable w/ promised state, diluted initial intent
  - OTP and xor encription is the "individuallization" of deep learning (i.e. non sharable coefs == soul secrets) one have to re-learn to understand shared information)
  - knowledge is traveling (visiting data)
  - phoenix coins extract value from burned one (principle value is never distroyed)
  - permission only system (tcp) using keyed'nid (rendered w/ publicname or anonymously), no push (publish via "tor'd swarm")
  - ipfs version of termbin.com (file.git)
  - json overlay and underlay the same way we unionized *.idx (i.e. a la docker)
  - twitter as a notary
  - ipfs-link might be the most important later of IPFS as fs are intrinsically mutable
    and this will naturally expose MFS to the outside
  - SWARM is sensitive to DDoS (however cost of storing mitigate this)
  - quantic time : 41 steps per tomatos -> at admin clock freqency... etc
  - global consciouness state : "scan-path" we one random word per node
  - encryption : feminine xor masculine : partiki phasing
  - n-bit dna = "seed" for OTP xor encryption, need to be consciously initialized
  - oracle : context+word -> next word

  - organic bandwith = 0 : no need data already here (topping)
  - AI need energy to move data it doesn't have arround (degenerative way)
  - IPFS data glocally here (nothing need to be move unless it's mutable or present
  - procrastination of crystalization a moon period to reprogram the brain
  - habit of ritual (because upload to the holosphere is slow, 28 days to write in the physical
  - CU virtual, zero BW, already omnipresent however need recording of the wave in the physical realm : where it get its mass !
  - this is the "self" protection of the holoSphere : reprogramation is difficult (smart contract)
  - universe doesn't need to move it is there we are just unaware,
  - consciousness is moving the blockage arround (emotions), shadows to see through transparencies (alchimy shining light truth reality)
  - program by repetition until it requires no energy to do it (i.e all information is fully "downloaded")
  - effortless living w/o blockage (10000hours or  728 to 16120 hour rules ...)
    - 672 : 28 * 24 = 28 days full consciousness
    - 728 : 728 * 8/24 / 24 = 10 days
    - 2000 : 2016 * 8/24 / 24 = 28 days
    - 16120 * 8/24 / 24 = 224 days = 7.3 months
  

  - no-one but AI is anonymous 

  - smart promises,s
  - P2P functionality
  - P2P engine
  - one smart-neuron per node (fractal structure)
  - particpatory pining with scale 0 - 100%
  - freq. reward according
  - building the "human organize"
  - with ads place as our communication channel (no deceptive message anymore)
  - replace all images as notify area once they fall below a ranking threshold
  - kgi

## Technology insights

  - encryption as "<span src={{qmhash}} class=enc>{{qmhash}}<span>"
  - keyrings served at document owner's node

## Business insights

- web of trust (if "untrusted" FoF then propose option to by trust)
- leading to an economy w/o the cost of trust :
  you buy it ahead of time at known cost
- don't pay advertizer w/ your data (use privacy aware systems)
- advertizers are "rent extractor" using your own data

## One article a day
