# Some Random Notes ... $Date: {{DATE}} $

=> draft a message in [scratchpad](file://home/michelc/scratchpad.txt)
<br>=> artifacts on file ([my98e](https://sys.artifacts.ai/my98e/)) !

### keybase signed notes:

- [notes](notes/index.md)

### Rule:

 -  There is no-one "anonymous" on the KIN network...
 -  ( AI is anonymous, and any communication is point 2 point
      and therefore it requires a "pre-meeting" )
 -  however public communication (one to many) is anonymous

 "Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous" ~ Albert Einstein


### AItems

 - check the "milestones" features for gitlab -> w/ webpage to view the roadmap
 - see also [AItems](AItems.md)

### fairKit (1st release)

 - IPFS
 - GIT (client,server, locally-centralized repository)
 - fairPad
 - fairBook (gitbook legacy)
     enquiry: can hook bookstack to [gitbook][1] ?
 - fairWiki (can be git's wiki)
 - fairCryption (keybase for the fairKIN P2P creation)
 - fairLinks (resolver)

[1]: https://www.bookstackapp.com/#features

### Section 1

- FairCryption
- FairAtoms
- Fairpad (ether pad/ framapad)
- FairGit 
- FairGate
- FairDNS and fairLNS (Domain and Location Naming Services)
- FairGateway ( like https://ipfs.blockringtm.ml ) (ethical gateways)

- FairTools
- FairBridge
- FairKit (IPFS mobile/iPad/computer): Package management i.e. installation of fairSphere to have graceful installation)
- fairRing
- FairMemory: IPFS (storage / database backend /  expiration pad)   https://framagit.org/fairsphere/fairmemory: should fairmemory be added here as it’s where we distribute the fairatms to (short term/ long term memory)

- FairMedia
- FairContent
- FairAssets
- Fairwiki
- FairLinks
- FairBooks (gitbook legacy, https://www.bookstackapp.com/)

### fairMemory

 - digital technology is nothing more than a "Memory Aid"
 - krystal technology is the integration of that memory in the organic world
   (krystal is bridging digital and organic)

### fairJourney :

 - past trajectory : trail (generated w. fairlogs)
 - future trajectory : projected destiny 



### universal law
 - law polarity
 (frequencies give the keys)

 - security is always from 2 points for KIO
 - system is open, each sphere is autonomous and have its own "law policing" intelligence
 - smart-contract can provide "zero-knowledge-proof" you abide by a contract :
    opening "verse" for you to join

 - fairKit doc on "readthedocs.org"

 - star tail (your journey / star map)


### protected by "resonnance"

 - digital protection 
 - DNA (KiQ)
 - emotions (iQ)
 - universal laws (politic / passport ...)
 - cosmic laws
 - heart mind, body, soul (light Q)


### site w/ "expirable" post-stramps"

like "park-meters" !

### DiT (true distributed GIT)

using P2P for storing mutables... and STUN TURN "cafes" for repository "routing"

### ACL and access management

ACL based 
Role based

target share: sym-keys encrypted w/ public keys (add to metadata of file)

### a change.org avec valeur legale

5G petition removed on change.org: https://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmUPYpnbu7x5i63SCrsVeAbvLsHWgiZxNkvU6nKSuAkLqW
more about "automatic censorship and liability"


### identity as a NFT owned by a CU !

a simple file with an unique ID, will do
(automatic registration ...)

 hash.1, hash.2 etc.. to deal with name space collision

 -- Identity is just some data attached to a key 
    All we need is some kind of data web 🕸

### recently edited (w/ log in filestore)

/my/recent/edited


### gc-bank : believe in your future

write yourself a check w/ GC-BANK 

 creating abundance
 
 
...

### kilometer notes convention

 s/.  /.\n/g
 s/  */ /g
 s/\n/&lt;br>\n/g

### turning security upside down ?

dont lock your own computer (in a jail),
do the other way around

put the outside in a box and set you free !

(outbound w/o inbound ?)


### "manual cache" a la decentralized / i.e local varnish/nynx

  w/ extensive caching over IPFS and always hit "304" unless "manual miss" 
  a sort of caching firewall
  
  run the internet in a jailbox !

### gist-asciidoctor et al.

data: .yml
table: .csv
text: / article / wiki : .md
books: .asciidoc
diagram: .dot .uml

etherpad :
  


### new git hash

use compress size in the blob header as it carries an entropy measure

### 226

 make a logger server using A-IM header
 https://evertpot.com/http/226-im-used

### mutable files

 * filestore place : filestore/:YYYY/:MM/:DD/:shard/:cname.:ext
 * global inode: /media/KINODE/blocks/


### mandalas :

 http://thenewcode.com/1149/Orbital-Resonance-in-SVG
 a/o
 http://thenewcode.com/1141/Recursive-SVG-Designs-Part-1
 

### oob channel to send code, view with xor "glasses" only

http://thenewcode.com/1116/Put-On-The-Sunglasses-Frank-An-Interactive-with-SVG-Masks

can be used are "turing test" as it will "identify"
the owner... (global self sovereign ID to replace all CAPTCHA)

http://thenewcode.com/1116/Put-On-The-Sunglasses-Frank-An-Interactive-with-SVG-Masks


### faircompass 

we direction to guide you 
as in http://thenewcode.com/524/Lost-An-SVG-Compass-Rose-Generator

.

### bash w/ audio

with swichable local or remote shell 
for live co-coding...
option for more than 2

1. connect to a session (webRTC meeting place)
2. pass the "bâton de command" 
3. STDIN is send to selected bash, STDOUT is broadcasted w/ voice

...

(kinstart project)

### fairavatar (federated over IPFS)

using peerid,orcid,openid etc.
see also [*](https://www.one-tab.com/page/HVNHlkE7S52jb3c3V-u_aA)

.

### federated server 

 using dns to find out the server a la "libravatar"
 
 dig +short SRV _avatars._tcp.EMAILDOMAIN
 0 0 80 avatars.example.com.

### salty hash

  use the salt before hashing the content,
  where salt is the hash of filename keyed data
  
for instance in :
{"data":"CAE=","links":[{"Cid":{"/":"QmYAXgX8ARiriupMQsbGXtKdDyGzWry1YV3sycKw1qqmgH"},"Name":"hello.txt","Size":0}]}
salt = mhash2('hello.txt',"CAE=")

the resulting multihash is "mf(salt=hash(alg1,name,data),7).mf(hash(alg2,content,salt),32-7)

is it really useful ? ... any wrapper w/ a nonce is "salty" 


### blockRing based compliance monitor

use a spot tracker with hand-soap dispencer etc..
with connected "cashier" with blockchain registered carrier

### artifacts filing ...

https://www.one-tab.com/page/0EABtdfOQBicWA7ijvMLDQ

source: https://github.com/Krysthal-Intelligence-Network/fairLedger/blob/master/tables/qm.md

### 60s TikTok as a carep repository !

pack content in frame at 24fps -> 24*60 = 1440 objects

720p => 3.796GB of raw-data

assuming 4bit per color it is still more than 1.8GB


### PoW replaced by proof of "stream"

 source resource cannot be deliver w/o stream ...
 therefore it give us a proof of elapsed time.

 a fast hashing farm can travel in its own future,
 however has to slow down to everyone's pace to be part to everyone's reality

### use ads as notification space

usually they are "placed" in the way : perfect for notification !


### brain transfer 

TheBrain revisited : 3 brains for collaboration and "drag-n-drop" of thoughts
(yours,mine,master)


### fibo or krysthal  ?

The grid test !
(using FFT to extract the grid ... then 12pts vs 10pts)
i.e. different harmonic content

.



### Stenography using Jot language (

any binary stream is a program :

Petr Pudlák (https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/10336/petr-pudl%c3%a1k), What are the simplest turing-complete systems?, URL (version: 2013-07-03): https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18235

see also [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_and_Jot)

as a side note [svg] is turing complete

> SVG: PostScript is TC by design, but what about the more modern vector graphics image format, SVG, which is written as XML, a (usually) not-TC document language? SVG also allows a slow encoding of Rule 110 (SVG files can be made arbitrarily large) and so is as TC as anything else.
> If that’s not enough, the SVG standard is large and occasionally horrifying: the (failed) SVG 1.2 standard tried to add to SVG images the ability to open raw network sockets.)

[svg]: https://github.com/tom-p-reichel/svg-is-turing-complete
.

## PoE w/ leaves

publish directory trees without leaves content...
a/o replace leaves with wrapper for ACL / REDIRECT / warning / mutable
mutable + spot = immutable

(space-time machine)

## demoRing (parallel fairVerse)

ConsciousBeings (aka CB) who don't run IPFS are directed to a centralized version
of IPFS i.e. "heliohost" version of the gateway storing
QCU & artifacts in cold storage while user running ther
mfs w/i the browser, this way the can have the full experience
in isolation of the "real" fairVerse 


## captcha etc.

turing test : human vs machine 

human able to talk (natural language)

Proof of balance (hCaptcha)
Proof of person (flip challenge: Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC))

- idea on the capability of human of common sense
- anti Sybil (small grow of network) : /!\ not scalable a la "G1"
- turst build over history 
- The social network are fast mixing,
  meaning that a random walk in the honest part of the network quickly approaches
  the uniform distribution.


even thought the technology is amaszing
both have it wrong ... proving you are human make no sense
 in an are of "AI amplified human" 
 
 . moreoever a conscious can borrow an non human form
   (our soul is NOT our physical person)
 . on can deploy a TuckMachine (using hCaptcha) to solve flip chalenge of idena
 . AI-resistant : human generated / common sense == limited in numbers == hackable

## robustify link w/ automatic blockRing decoration !

changing all url into a blockchain...
(all keyword into a fairRing ... -> sementic web by construction :)

source: url
content: log
snapshot trail & (spot)

(link to archives : archive.is or perma.cc)

see also: http://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/about/


## source tracking ...

RCS keywords generalized
remove '$qm: $' only is file match the source :)
hence all the derived file points to it source-chain !

## linker / shortcut / stats

a la https://fblinker.com/ + https://perma.cc

 see also : https://www.lifewire.com/shortening-long-links-3486603
 
 GET+URL->shortkey

.

## apps + website gen 

+ glideapp + status 4 merge together


## security by fragility !

take only one link to undo it all
Borromean rings, [Efimov state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efimov_state)
remove one: it falls apart !

phys,soul,mind
Real,imaginary,symbolic : (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan)
physical,feminie,masculine
physic,emotion,intelect

[A24978](https://oeis.org/A242978) -> curious to check how it look in dozenal system ?

## knots and bacteria

backteria better than human at undoing knots

see [Matt Parker][mp]'s [talk](https://youtu.be/1wAaI_6b9JE?t=1290)

[mp]: https://qwant.com/?q=Matt+Parker+math

## value system

human and living being as "krysthal" nodes
acting as value amplififier with factor 2x
(as a photo ampli: bouncing light in resonant cavity
 if proper frequency we put our own energy
 in the right direction
 if not we absorbe the light and diffuse it in mundaine task
)

 KIND: network need tiles of 12p (full trust)
 
 krysthal tiles :
 4P -> 5sq -> 12 shapes -> 60 surfaces + 4 communicators -repeat 
 
 4com: 60/4=15 and 60/4*5=75 -> 60 x 5 = 300
       64/4=16     64/4*5=80 -> 64 x 5 = 320
 
 64 * 4 = 256 -> 64 x 5 = 256 + 64 = 320
 

## git trail store previous commitid

 hence making git act as a blockchain :)
 the commitids can be pushed on [artifacts](https://sys.artifacts.ai/xkq5s/)
 note: git id always points to previous version (backward chain)
 whereas tag are mutable and points to next file (forward chain)
 
## easy blockchain

by implementing the "$prev: $" RCSKeyword in git,
it makes a natural blockchain (secured with SHA1)

HEAD can be predicted with "mutable" (forward chain)
  has that reference the creator of the previous block
  so fork are totally different chains

## spotted file system

files system w. date and time, spot instead of inode
and trajectory trail. (branch as backups)
.

## UV light in fridge

one for each shelves powered on existing light w/ timer
,


## hacker/space/virus 

slamer : 17min to infect all the internet (2002)
wannacry : few hour w/ payload
.

## after social distancing : corporate distancing

moving toward unenclosed carrier for all comm.


### Streaming mutable

a mutable that has room for the '$Next: one$' with a '$Key: $' to 
verify it ! ([verified forward chain]])

### current-see mutual credit

see also [*](https://medium.com/fairchain/the-faircene-explosion-2-3-game-changing-possibilities-in-a-world-of-unenclosable-carriers-7c1a97f32e9c)

interrest-free lending !
changing the time cost of money, which means that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later.

[trible bottom lines][tbl] accounting (reputation) 

One possible approach to triple credit rating could be:
Your people rating affects your interest rates, in order to make it more attractive for you to borrow money if you’re deemed to affect people positively through your commerce, and less attractive if you’re not.
Your planet rating affects your transaction fees, with the idea being that polluters and extractors pay a tax to the system to offset the environmental costs borne by everyone. If you have a reputation for positively impacting the planet, you could actually incur a negative tax, which means you’re essentially being paid to transact by the system, in reflection of the good you externalize.
Your profit rating affects your credit limits, similar to existing credit ratings, with the idea being that your likelihood to pay back funds ought to remain a central factor in how much you can borrow.


[tbl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line#People,_the_social_equity_bottom_line

## Privacy is not negotiable

* it has to be built in !
* creation of $USER.key file (ideally on a RAMDISK or within an agent)

## origamy hospitals

* 

## Olympics postponed

  world is shifting !!!
  last time during war cancellation ...
  
  our society as we know it won't recover,
  leaving room to the new !
  
.


## online wait-line to allow social distance

 blockchain based, with notification etc.
 
.

# vimwiki a super cool knowledge base

 FYI : I love the [[vimwiki]] so much,
 your simple write a bunch of text files and all
 the wikiLink/navigation/pagecreation etc. is taking care seamlessly by the tool ...
 (I can share my knowledge with very little friction now !! it is fantastic)
 ...I even envision porting it online at will supersede tiddly wiki:
 hmmm let's call it #[[fairWiki]]  (read more here : https://github.com/gradual-quanta/fairwiki)
 
and example can be: https://github.com/michel47/hlr/tree/master/wiki
(the wikilinks doesn't work yet as I have yet to write the peace of js to resolve them)

# Map vs. Index

The difference is all there ...
index: someone is curating the knowledge for you and then you [[search]]
among what you are allowed to see
(for instance you can only search google data on google server).
with [[maps]] you are free do navigate and discover on your own.
"re-inventing" the wheel is necessary in the creative-learning process.

## Jordan Greenhall
Most recently I just got pulled into a project to try to figure out how
to actually actualize the notion of wisdom [00:05:00] in our emerging
society, because a lot of the problems that we’re dealing with are
problems of a gigantic wisdom deficit that exists in our contemporary
civilization and learning how to actually take wisdom from being something
that we gesture at to be something that’s actually practically applied
in our daily lives continuously. Is a project that I’m just getting
involved in. I could go on forever, by the way, the list is probably
several hundred.
