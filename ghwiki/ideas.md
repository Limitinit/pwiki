- all traffic lights to have "wildlive" sensors for them tp safely cross !
  (see https://openspacetrust.org/wildlife-linkages-program/)
- ipfs cache a la https://raw.githack.com
- google-photo cache a la https://raw.githash.com
- ask for original rather than a "digital copy" : (https://originalsm.ml)
- an shortener guaranteed to be <25c for ([[https://linkedin.com/|linked'in]])
- wemux via ipfs pubsub and webrtc audio-only !
- [fund][fundings] - w/ matching scope [blockRing][blockRings], [holoRing][holoRings], [PlaneraryOS][POCE], [IPMS][IPMS]
- "Bio" PuF derived key for one factor in Identity verification
   (resistance to replay w/ ZeroKnowledge proof, non-revokable)
    require a one time registration of public key (ToFu) for a shared secret.
- (revokable bio signature) HearthMath Signature
   fft and variablility analysis to extract a "conscious unit of identity" 
    
- Stockastic/Quantic field ID /  PuF key generation for "Bio2factor",
   something  you have (biometric non-revokable, + something you know revokable
   (shared second factor in a DH-way);
   

### cool concepts
