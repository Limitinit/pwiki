# fake gurus and snake-oil-spirituality



fibonacci is not center: 
 all spirals are centered (math: grows away from fixed center)


If is when we draw spiral with circle arc that it becomes wably
and off-centered ... (like the scared construction of fibonacci spiral


>  what is bothering me is that to have a fibonacci spiral to intersect
the kristal one you have to scale up fibonacci so the "story" that
fibonacci spiral collapse or is unbalance and wabling off center is
"snake-oil-spirituality" for fake-gurus -- it is using the math to
deceptively tell what the we want...  I am sensing that the limitation of
fibonacci is not from this magnifying fibonacci spiral by 10 and leaving
krystal at scale 1 leads the spiral to intersect like in the below image


all are log-spirals : r(θ) = dₙ^(2/π)θ·tan(p)
where dₙ = n + √(n^2 + 4) / 2

"[Fibonacci Spiral, which is a *vampiring* spiral ...][2]" ~Jere Rivera-Dugenio:

Where this vampiring comes from ? 
as all log spiral follow the same law for growth, so it's probably from the 10 vs 12 points grid
dropping 2 essentials once makes all differences.
