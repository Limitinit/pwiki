## Goodbye Pareto principle, welcome the new distribution

In a 2006 working paper titled "Goodbye Pareto Principle, Hello Long
Tail",[EB2006] Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Duncan Simester
found that, by greatly lowering search costs, information technology in
general and Internet markets in particular could substantially increase
the collective share of hard-to-find products, thereby creating a longer
tail in the distribution of sales.

They used a theoretical model to show how a reduction in search costs will
affect the concentration in product sales. By analyzing data collected
from a multi-channel retailing company, they showed empirical evidence
that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated
sales distribution, when compared with traditional channels. An 80/20
rule fits the distribution of product sales in the catalog channel quite
well, but in the Internet channel, this rule needs to be modified to
a 72/28 rule in order to fit the distribution of product sales in that
channel. The difference in the sales distribution is highly significant,
even after controlling for consumer differences.
